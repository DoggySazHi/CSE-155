# Memory
- Yes, this is a continuation of [[Lecture 2-8-2024]]
- Subconscious movement from memory from short-term memory to long-term memory
- Exploit to store actions into the implicit/procedural long-term memory
	- Define in terms of units/actions
## Short-term memory
- Short term (duh)
- Tested by making people remember a series of numbers and repeating them - copy from speech (heard) to written (hand-write tanscriptions)
- About 7 "units" (in this case, numbers) is 50% of people
- Chunking is a method for humans to remember, so we can store more "information" per unit
	- Example: why memorize 16 binary digits if you can memorize 4 decimal digits and convert it back later when you need it?
- Chunk actions together to allow the whole action to go together
	- Trait of experienced/advanced users when it comes to memorizations: combine a series of actions into one general action
- How to use for UI design?
	- Don't provide more than 9 choices, 5 or less is preferred
	- Allow chunking to help short-term memory
		- Groups, modes, labels, margins
	- Use representative icons or obvious placeholders
	- Use visual landmarks
		- A way to group things together, such as a big option and a ton of suboptions
			- e.g., a big clipboard icon for a paste button, with small buttons for other options (cut, format, text only)
			- Or a font choice (big dropdown with font and size), with smaller options for like color, underline/italics/etc.
	- By "9 choices" you can have like, 30 buttons (e.g., MSWord's toolbar) but you can group the features that are relevant (e.g., clipboard, font, paragraph)
		- How to adapt for more advanced users? Chunking/visual landmarks help to put things together to get around the 9 choices rule, meaning they can quickly access the feature they need, while allowing them to know where a specific option is
		- Big boxes, large lines, letters: different visual elements (e.g., between paragraph style with big boxes, paragraph options have lines, font choice has A/a) distinguishes them
			- Vertical lines/rules aren't landmarks, but they help chunk things up
		- Similar looking icons even split apart is still a bad UI because you need to read the text to know what is going on
## Stress
- An emotion state (a spectrum?) of heightened arousal
- At one end is distress that invokes negative feelings
	- Can impair performance
	- Can disrupt behavior
	- Can have negative consequences for health, if severe enough
	- Example: selfie stick because it's not balanced and can be too heavy to carry - but useful in some few cases
	- Physical consequences: using computers for an extended amount of time can be stressful, e.g., carpal tunnel
	- Emotional stress: games, wanting to do something better (can fall below)
- At the other end is eustress, which is challenging but rewarding
	- Can serve as an energizing force motivating users to perform well
	- A motivational factor when people are using computer systems
		- Some challenge makes it not feel "too easy," useful for things like games
		- Not so much for say, productivity software
- Many ways to classify stress
- Types of stressors: Environmental and Psychological and More
	- Environmental: Noise, vibration, heat, lighting (physical things around you)
		- E.g., phone vibration, getting notifications too often
	- Psychological: anxiety, fatigue, frustration, anger (emotional things within someone)
	- Time: deadlines, missed appointments, long meetings, short notices
		- Usually social
	- Organizational: severe penalties, policy change, favoritism, excessive duties
		- Often encountered within society, such as a work place
- External vs internal stressors
	- Or direct vs indirect
	- External: influence the quality of information received, can affect human precision, and usually identifiable
		- noise, sleep loss, predictable actions
		- Determine what type of stress, and usually can be resolved
	- Internal: fear, incentives: not easily predicted, difficult to identify, and can easily vary between people (e.g., instinct)
		- Raised differently? different reaction to a certain input? previous similar experience?
		- Qualitative, not easy but can be statistically linked to certain cohorts if searched
	- ![[Pasted image 20240220135502.png]]
	- Impact of stressors: affects performance: indirect affects information processing which affects performance, direct affects performance even if you think around it
- Psychological Stressors:
	- Anxiety, fatigue, frustration, anger, fear, embarassment, loss of esteem
	- Working memory loss
	- Perceptual or attention narrowing or tunneling
	- Strategic shifts, e.g., tendency to react too quickly
	- Effect depends on individual factors:
		- Personality traits
			- big five for personality traits - applies to non-humans as well
		- Level of experience
		- Life stress
		- Level of physiological arousal induced by the stressor
			- Yerkes-Dodson law
				- Empirical relationship between pressure and performance
					- Performance increases with physiological arousal, only up to a point
					- Simple tasks are different from complex tasks: performance inherently is lower for the latter, but you need to add some stress so they don't think it's too easy and not use it at max performance
					- Counter-intuitive for productivity software but they need to do something to know it's doing something
		- Mental workload
			- The demands of tasks imposed on the limited information processing capacity of hte brain
			- Supply-demand relationship - don't do information overload
				- Reserve capacity is available for performance - once it gets depleted, performance drops
				- Forced feeding for resources (?)
				- Red line shows the difference where a person would not be able to process the information given to them, dropping performance for a given task
				- The graph is mostly useful only for novices
				- Do not change interface abruptly
	- Measuring workloads
		- Time required / Time available (TR/TA ratio)
			- Based on task analysis
			- Percentage computed per time unit on task timeline
			- Useful predictor, but difficult to construct - project management
		- Primary task measures
			- Measure the *influence* of mental workload
		- Secondary task methods
			- Measure the *reserve capacity*
		- Physiological measures
			- Stress! very subjective
- Interface design tips:
	- Reduce stressors in your interface
		- Optimal vibration duration, automatic brightness adjustment, etc.
	- Compensate for environmental stressors
		- Alternative methods for input depending on the environment, but not redundant
		- Walking and typing is way better because of autocorrect, improved mobile keyboard layout, etc.
	- Find and exploit optimal level of arousal (OLA)
		- Facilitate faster transition from novice to expert
		- Back to Yerkes-Dodson law
		- Example research: stressor for learning:
			- Provide a primary (easy to learn) set, then make it harder to use to promote the alternative method
				- Forced deprecation, technically
			- Certain letters are hard for the system to recognize - use alternative to override the issue
			- Also technically "not a bug, but a feature"
				- We can convince people basically to use one system over another... making lazy software?
## Human Errors and Accidents
- Human error are instances where a planned activity fails to achieve its intended outcome
- Human errors can result in accidents
- Some differentiated errors and accidents in the context of human factors:
	- Errors: intentionally performed incorrect actions thinking that they were correct (like picking a wrong answer on a test)
		- Hard to avoid other than actual training
	- Accidents: unintentionally performed incorrect actions, for example, accidentally pressing the Yes button instead of the No button (like misbubbling on a scantron when you knew the right answer)
		- Can be avoided with a confirmation popup, but may take longer if the action is done often
- e.g., Climate Orbiter issue: mismatch between metric and imperial units, crashed
- Same thing with another flight with Air Canada Flight 143
- Euthanizing a dog on accident????
	- All of these three are accidents - human mistakes which were not done on purpose
- How to reduce these erorrs?
	- Graphical, auditory, haptic feedback on potential errors
		- Correctness feedback informs users if an action is correct/incorrect
		- Directive and facilitative feedback directs users to correct actions
	- Provide feedback to the user for their actions
		- Facilitative feedback: know what something does before you do it
			- E.g., mouse-over to get a tooltip for the action
		- Correctness feedback: know what's happening after you do it (or try to do it)
			- E.g., popup if an error occurs and how to resolve it
		- Directive feedback: know what's going to happen before you do it, just in case
			- E.g., popup warning you of possible consequences
	- Limit human interactions and don't trust them
		- Automate human actions (e.g., textbox focus, autocomplete, cursor position, validated input like numbers only)
		- Also highlight errors or current input to make sure they don't mistype or write in the wrong field
		- Validation is a big thing: e.g., leaving a page that isn't saved, or putting data that *might* be wrong and allow the user to override if possible
			- Colors and auto-select might be useful on popups, e.g., defaulting to save since the consequence of saving is usually less worse than the consequence of not saving
			- Realize the user might be spamming through popups or speedrunning through the program and not reading anything
			- However, deciding to make it a full blocker (e.g., limiting keyboard input) could be bad for accessibility but could force the user to pay attention and not spam
		- Suggest/placeholder hints for the next action, e.g., knowing what to place in a certain textbox, or seeing that a field is incomplete such as putting all 16 digits of a credit card number
		- Invest time in interface design to avoid (or reduce) confusions and human errors
			- Use an iterative design process and meet with the users to see if they know what to do/how to use it
				- Design, test, redesign, loop, then finally develop
			- Make sure people can use it *well*
			- User in the loop approach
				- Participatory design (get people to use it normally, useful for general usage)
				- Elicitation studies (bring/force unique interactions, useful for accessibility)
				- Co-design/design workshops: get more people, group, get different designs (like participatory design but with cohorts)
				- Focus groups (get a specific user group's requests, e.g., accessibility or access or target group)
