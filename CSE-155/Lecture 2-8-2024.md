# The Human Brain
- A lot of things we don't know about the human brain, and we want to know more
- The brain does perception, cognition, handles stress/workload, and produces accidents and errors
- It links our sensors with our responders

## The Brain
- Tons of synapses to be depressed af, with billions of neurons
- Most complex biological structure known
	- Not binary
- Enables human capacity for
	- Pondering
	- Remembering
	- Recalling
	- Reasoning
	- Deciding
	- Communicating
	- Etc.
- With associations and meaning attached to sensory input, humans are vastly superior to the machines they interact with
	- We associate and add meaning to all of the inputs receive and what we give
	- Computers are pretty bad at knowing what we want, given input (e.g., context)
	- Humans can also filter noise and understand perspectives and fill in the gaps
		- We only need a little bit of information, know how to infer, and understand pretty accurately
			- Nanoseconds! Subconsciously
		- Computers are again, pretty bad at this
			- Also slow, since they process all information as-is
	- Taking a nap before something important (e.g., exam)
		- Mostly to leave the brain to process - write from short term memory to long term
			- Rather than overwriting short-term memory after studying a lot
- Perception
	- The first stage of processing for sensory input
	- Associations formed
- Psychophysics
	- Branch of experimental psychology (since the 19th century)
	- Relationship between human perception and physical phenomena
	- Experimental method:
		- Present subject with two stimuli, one after the other
		- Stimuli differ in a physical property (e.g., frequency)
		- Randomly vary the difference
		- Determine threshold below which the two stimuli appear "the same"
		- This threshold is the "just noticeable difference" (JND)
			- e.g., vibration, sound, light/color
			- Also subjective against different people (e.g., colorblind, tone deaf)
		- Why important?
			- E.g., mp3: bitrate compression, how far can we make a small file without the human noticing?
				- How do we annoy audiophiles?
	- Optical Ambiguity
		- Two images (or more) from one
		- Cube: which surface is at the front? (only outline)
		- Rubin vase: wine goblet or two faces?
		- Or seeing one thing or another, depending on angle or human instinct
	- Optical Illusion
		- Perceived difference due to instinct or heuristics
	- Ambiguity and Illusion: movement depending on frame rate - also differences between animated cartoon (higher frame rate, brain can interpolate) vs hand-drawn (less frame rate, needs to simulate motion blur)
		- Note that some frames are blank as well, so you can save memory/render time by holding a frame down
		- We can simulate 3D surfaces with shading/rendering, or box shadow for depth on a 2D window
		- Texture for an analogy of physical hardware, or a pressing animation
		- Hover as well vs click - visual feedback and possibly audio/depth
- Turns out certain shades of green and red placed next to each other creates "color vibration"
	- Silently added a color gradient to their colors to smoothly distinct the colors without shadows
		- Also changed the colors themselves for a better gradient
- Perceptual mismatch
	- Vision dominates when senses conflict (tactition vs. vision)
	- E.g., virtual reality vs real-world controls
		- Perceived in virtual reality even if the physical controls don't fully match
		- So, we can screw up their senses and gaslight them into feeling something
		- (Simulation sickness: we screwed up your perception and now you're confused)
		- Used for haptic redirection in virtual reality by creating perceptual mismatch or illusion
- Illusion in other senses
	- If illusion is possible for the visual sense, the same should be true for the other senses
		- Tactile/haptic illusion: phantom limb (oops, no arm!)
		- Auditory illusion: shepard tone, infinitely rising tone, distance/direciton
		- Taste illusion: pure capsaicin, that one miracle berry, pinching your nose, probably electrocution,
		- Smell illusion: not really, probably electrocution
			- Too many scents as well, but that's more of sensory overload
- Cognition
	- The human process of conscious intellectual activity
		- Thinking reasoning, deciding, etc.
	- Spans many fields
		- Neurology, linguistics, anthropology, etc.
	- Sensory phenomena are easy to study because they exist in the physical world
- Making a decision
	- Not possible to directly measure hte time for a human to "make a decision"
		- Start? End? how? where? what inputs? how do we know?
	- Sensor stimulus and motor response that bracket the decision
	- Requires multiple parts: sensory reception, transmission (sensor -> brain), processing, transmission (brain -> muscle), and activation of response

## Memory: short and long-term memory
- A vast repository
- Long-term memory has two regions:
	- Declarative/explicit area: information about events in times nad objects in the external world
	- Implicit/procedual area: How to use objects and how to do things
- Short-term memory:
	- Small, quick read access
	- Working-memory
	- Active information, readily available for access
	- Amount of working memory is small: about 7 ($\pm$ 2) units
