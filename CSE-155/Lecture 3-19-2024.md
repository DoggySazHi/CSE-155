- Pie menu: shorter, yet equal distance to items
	- Measured 15% in increase in speed for 8 items
	- Variants
		- Implements submenus, interactions in/on menus, etc.
	- Tradeoffs:
		- Size, precision - limited amount of options, or hard to select - also enabling the pie menu and selecting is weird
- Marking Menus (1993)
	- Delayed appearance of menu graphics (0.33 seconds) allows quicker invocation if the user remembers the direction they move their stylus
		- Up to 3.5 times faster than using the graphic menu if they have to select to open
	- Makes the user remember how to do common interactions
		- Kind of rhythmic (authors inspired by music): create a contiguous pattern that can be memorized, which allows the user to remember
			- Certain strokes allows faster interaction
		- No need to wait for GUI, computer will recognize the input - draw your strokes quickly
- Microsoft dropdown menus (1988)
	- Three different keyboard mechanisms
		- Control-XYZ or function keys for direct invocation
		- Alt + letter: "mnemonics" - more controls
		- Arrow keys then enter: selection of menu items
	- Two different mouse actions:
		- Press-and-hold
		- Click-click (double-click)
- Microsoft XP "Personalized Menus" (2001)
	- Options that were frequently used would show up first, closer to the mouse
		- Less-often used items were put in a dropdown
			- Distributed through the list when you expand, actually - just putting back the items where they're normally
	- Often disabled, because it looks weird (missing features or broken?) and it makes the menu dynamic and keep changing
		- People did not like them
- OpenLook and Motif (1988/1989)
	- Look and feel for Unix from Sun in collaboration with Xerox
		- Used some of Star's look-and-feel
		- Unusual pull-down menus with defaults
	- In competition with "Motif" which ended up winning
- iPhone Settings + Menus (2007 and on)
	- New ways of interacting
		- All finger-sized (so you don't fudge things)
		- Sliders for toggles
		- Lots of hierarchical menus
		- Spin menus
	- Starting with iOS 7: more stylized
- Game Controllers and Consumer Electronics
	- Remotes with like a hundred buttons, and arrow keys
	- Big menus, on the screen (soft-display)
	- Or, you can make a simple remote like the Wii and use IR to point on the screen UI
		- TV remotes are copying this design: simple remote, few sponsored buttons, but mostly interacted with IR as well
- Standard Web Design
	- Fixed menus of links at the top
		- All hyperlinks are considered "menus"
	- Pull-out menu: you click on it, and a menu pops down, covering content below
	- Pull-down menus: Click to expand, but dedicated space
	- Accordion Menus: click to expand, often used for hierarchical menus (honestly no idea diff with before)
- More Research with Menus
	- Fisheye menus
		- Alphabetical ordering helps, but it's weird because of precision issues to pick something that is not under the fisheye
			- Kinda why Apple gave up on the idea
	- Horizontal submenus
		- Turns out text moves horizontally
	- Menus on your skin??
		- Put foundation and click on your face???
	- Menus on VR
		- How to interact naturally in 3D?
- Recommendations
	- Randomizing menus: not good initially, but otherwise no difference vs organized
		- I.e., ordered hierarchy is no better than randomized for experienced users
	- Hierarchy names are hard
	- Card sorting helps categorizing things mentally
	- There should be no overlap between categories
		- Especially useful for professionals/experts
- Smith and Mosier
	- Some are outdated, e.g., allowing selection by pointing
	- Some are obvious, e.g., provide feedback of what is selected
	- Some are still relevant:
		- Provide option names as commands and not questions
		- Letter codes/mnemonics should be the first letter of the command
		- Use consistent codes for mnemonics
		- People get angry at machines - understand how to communicate
		- Use "Logical" order, e.g., in order of what will be used or most frequent first
- Breadth vs Depth
	- When lots of items:
		- Long menus, shallow depth = breadth
		- Shorter menus, deeper = depth
	- Norman (1991): Breadth preferred over depth
		- At most 3 levels deep or else users get lost and confused
	- Jacko (1996): Errors and time increased as depth increased
		- Users rated deep menus as more complex
	- Larson (1998): Similar results for website organization: breadth > depth
- Implementing lots of items in a menu
	- Ceaparu (2004): Studied 645 items
		- One alphabetical list, ordered vs good categories for logical ordering
		- Categories >> Alphabetical List
	- Mixed results about reordering based on frequency of use
		- Michell (1989): Users were disoriented when reordered and slower
		- Greenberg (1985): Users were faster when most frequent were at top
		- Sears (1994): Combined, mixed menus worked well
		- So... crap.

## Pointing and Selecting
- There are a ton of pointing devices...
	- Lasers, mise, trackpad, cameras, IR remotes, touchscreens, whatever
- And what do you control? A cursor
	- This is the term used for **both** pointer position and text input position
		- One is the hand, and one is the blinking line - they aren't the same, can appear at the same time, and have different contexts
	- Text cursors will be discussed later: now we will focus on normal pointers
		- Pointer cursor will often change shape to show next action
		- Often no pointer cursor if using direct touch, like a touch screen
- Step Keys: moving a text cursor, sometimes
	- Used in games like a D-pad, or arrow keys on a keyboard
		- Some special keys can quickly adjust instead of just normal fine stepping, like Home/End keys
- The mouse
	- yeah, still the best pointing device because it can be very precise
	- Comfortable, fast, and accurate
	- Engineered to not move when you click the mouse
	- Cursor moves straight as the hand moves in an arc
	- Various gain functions
		- Pixels per cm, DPI, etc.
- Joysticks
	- Often used in aviation, also can be used for racing simulators since they provide analog input
	- Computer input for games
	- Most are "rate controlled"
		- Self-centering springs
		- Movement controls rate of cursor movement
		- "isometric" - stick doesn't seem to move because when you release, it goes back
	- In spacial interaction, you'd need to return the hand to the initial space - to determine the end of the action, the item is in the right position (i.e., absolute positioning)
		- But a joystick does not guarantee this - hence why we have a spring to "automatically" stop moving when the goal is finished
	- Position controlled
		- Absolute position of stick controls position
		- No spring - stick stays where you leave it (i.e., no string)
			- Useful if you need it to stay in one position for an extended amount of time, like a gear shift
			- But not useful if you finish an action and not realize the input is still moving
- Pointing stick
	- Trackpoint, with a rate-controlled isometric joystick
	- Significant iteration and experimentation
		- "Ten years of human factors work"
	- Material of the stick matters
	- Placement of buttons
		- Where to put the nub? Where to click the mouse?
	- Transfer function
		- How do you map force to movement?
	- Training helps performance
		- Well yeah, it helps you get better at things
	- Most people don't use the trackpoint, but it doesn't interrupt them from using the trackpad or keyboard, which is pretty good
- Tablets
	- Rand Tablet: 1964
	- Handwriting and graphics input
		- Useful for CAD/CAM
	- Move stylus or puck or finger on a surface - *not* a display screen
	- Steve Jobs didn't think drawing pads would ever be useful, and that touch screens would take over
		- Also needed to be big to be useful
	- People got scared of putting water on a drawing pad table, with water droplets and such
- Touchscreens
	- Stylus vs finger
		- Tradeoffs:
			- Naturalness
			- Accuracy
				- Amount of content that can fit, vs button padding
			- Blocking the view of the content (obscurement problem)
	- How to hold a tablet?
	- palm and hand removal, like resting?
	- How to quickly input, like a virtual keyboard or at least as fast as one (handwriting)
- Occlusion Problem
	- Or the "fat-finger problem" (Vogel)
	- No haptic feedback, increases errors
	- Potter: Early research by on offset cursor
		- Contemporary systems use variations like offset animation (like showing which key you pressed below as a popup above)
		- Click on a key and still pop up
			- Slight delay nowadays since if you type fast enough, you won't ever see them
			- Extra functionality - hold button down for accents
	- More issues on a tablet
		- Increased selection area
		- Replaced buttons with *directional* sliding
			- Gestural interaction
		- Enabled mode change by tapping on the virtual buttons
		- Example from Microsoft:
			- Get rid of the cursor: if you're within of a certain bound, you get the object
				- E.g., resizing a window by grabbing a "small" edge, approximations
				- But how about ambiguity? Add gestural interactions to know which one is interacting with
					- E.g., swipe down to interaction with a certain switch/trigger, horizontal for another, etc.
				- Pullout knob can be used to have menus triggerable by touchscreen
			- A mix of button "orientations"/available gestures can allow for both fast and precise selection
			- Holding/preview can be used to provide extra information on selection modes
- Large Touchscreens
	- Projector or TVs
	- Vertical or tabletop
		- Smart-board, new projectors
		- Original Microsoft "surface"
	- Single or multiple people
	- Classrooms, museums, small meetings, etc.
	- E.g., Microsoft Surface Hub - big touchscreen TV with Windows on it
		- Didn't work well - biggest problem was interaction issues, as said previously
	- Remote interaction:
		- Laser input, to point at something specific
	- Pen input on a large screen
		- Hand occlusion - you have both direct input under the pen, but you have inefficient movements because people needed to see under their wrist for things
		- Position can be represented for occlusion with a ball and stick - to implement better real-time occlusion prevention or just general UI design
- Novel solution
	- Virtual Pen, to create a 3D perspective
