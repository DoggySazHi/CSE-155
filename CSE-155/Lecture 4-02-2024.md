Keystroke-Level Model
- Actions that occur at the keystroke level
- Doesn't have to be a keyboard, but it can refer to any action that is done on a user interface
- Earliest and most comprehensive model in HCI
	- Not to be confused with modeling approaches, but rather a model itself
	- Predicts human performance with interactive computing systems
	- Predicts expert, error-free task completion times
- Requires:
	- Task (or a series of tasks)
		- Requires a goal to measure
	- Method used
		- How they approach the task/mental model
	- Command language of the system
		- Entry mechanism or UI
	- Motor skill parameters of the user
		- Speedrun moving a mouse
	- Response time parameters of the system
		- For the system to tell the user that the interaction was successful or not
- Calculation:
	- $t_{EXECUTE} = t_K + t_H + t_P + t_D + t_M + t_R$
	- where:
		- K: Keystroking (pressing a key - tapping it on some mechanical device)
			- Ex. Typing a letter, number, or modifier keys
				- 90 WPM: 0.12s
				- 55 WPM: 0.20s
				- 40 WPM: 0.28s
				- Unfamiliar: 1.2s
		- H: Homing (moving your finger to the right key - adjust limbs)
			- Ex. 0.4s to move the hand between mouse and keyboard
		- P: Pointing (moving a device to select a target, mouse or stylus)
			- Ex. 0.8 to 1.5s, with an average of 1.1s to point a mouse
			- Can also use Fitts' Law, with $\log_2\left(\frac{A}{W} + 1\right)$
		- D: Drawing (after pointing, you follow a path in a desired motion, cursor movement)
			- Doesn't have to actually be drawing, but tasks like moving a folder on a desktop or selecting text via the mouse counts
			- Ex. $0.9*n_D + 0.16*l_D$ to draw $n_D$ line segments of $l_D$ length
		- M: Mental preparation (Typing, anything thinking about what to do)
			- Ex. 1.35s to think what to draw
		- R: System response (The computer latency to tell you that the input was detected)
			- Ex. *it really depends on the software*
	- Some operators are omitted or repeated, depending on the task
		- For example, if $n$ keystroking operations are required:
			- $t_K$ becomes $n * t_K$ 
	- Handling parallelism is difficult with this model (e.g., input buffers)
		- Can be considered system response times, since the user might not need to wait for system response for tasks like data entry
	- Can break down interactions into little events like tapping buttons, good estimate and reliable
- Prediction:
	- How do we teach a person how to delete a 5 letter word to replace it with another 5 letter word?
		- Thinking how to delete a word
		- Press backspace five times
		- Think of another word to type
		- Type five more letters
		- Verify the word was typed correctly
	- This is ten keystrokes and three mental operations, so $t_{EXECUTE} = (4 * t_M) + (15 * t_K)$
- Sensitivity Analysis
	- When parameters are treated as variables, you can determine how execution time is impacted when certain processes take longer/shorter to do
	- Also can compare between different use models
- Comparison
	- KLM is easier than GOMS, and can predict task completion time without having to build a prototype
		- Useful for comparing alternatives
		- Accounts for system factors
	- But, KLM cannot account for errors, only expert behavior
		- Doesn't apply to novice and intermediate users
			- Happens in a loop: it's possible that one mistake leads to another mistake, and that possibility makes it an issue
			- Even worse, expert users can make errors once in a while, and it's hard to distinguish it as its own category, since making and fixing an error are distinct actions
	- It also cannot account for mental workload, stress, or fatigue
	- Not useful for tasks that require reasoning (e.g., excessive mental computation, where you're not actively inputting anything)
		- E.g., inputting mathematical equations - you have to know how to nest the formula you're trying to do, and that's a second skill that's being measured when it comes to computation time
	- Cannot model learning the system - needs to go back to parallel practice
## Research, Engineering, and Design
- Formulas, stats, and other things - what's the difference between the three groups if they all calculate things?
	- Well yeah, that's why they work together
- The skill sets are different, however
	- Engineers and designers build things, bringing form and function into reality
		- Engineers know what's possible and what isn't
		- Designers know what the user/client want
	- Big tension/trade-off between form and function
		- How do you make something look good while making well, useful?
		- Do you put function first and put form around it?
		  Or do you do form and add the function later?
		- Really depends on ideology
- What is research?
	- Definition 1: Careful or diligent search
		- In a structured way, find information, find details, and have some pattern to cover
			- Needs to have organization in data scraping, can't be ADHD rabbit holes
	- Definition 2: Collecting information about a particular subject
		- Collecting information about a particular subject
			- Risk of bias, e.g., survey/voting
			- Also depends on phasing
	- Definition 3: Investigation or experimentation aimed at the discovery and interpretation of facts, the revision of accepted theories or laws considering new facts
		- Discovering something new, or a new interface not done before
		- Or figuring out why a fact is one way or another, not attempting to disprove
