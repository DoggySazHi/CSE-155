Sketchpad, Bravo, Interlisp: Based on the interactions with the system, the actions can change
- design of the scroller, behavior of the scroller
- the design can change, but nowadays they're more static and eventually become static
	- E.g., Stringscope on Interlisp has the scrollbar on the left
		- Xerox Star moves to the right to remove visual clutter, with an arrow
	- Prevent occlusion when a pointer was moving to a scrollbar
	- Elevator scroll bar to move up/down
	- Allow selection without precise target selection
		- Right button: move by percent, or by window rather than page
		- Don't even need to be in the elevator to move - still allows you to move up and down (i wonder where it was stolen from...)
			- See before: "Reduce the hand-eye coordination problems users were experiencing"
			- Means you can scroll without making sure your mouse stays locked on the scrollbar
			- No need to keep checking the positioning of the cursor, you focus on your content and you don't need to keep micro-adjusting your mouse position/control
			- Visual sort problem on mobile as well, where you're splitting your focus between two different contexts, slower than doing those contexts individually
- Apple Lisa (1983)
	- Arrows that point up and down, on the ends of the scrollbar
	- Page buttons to go to the next frame
		- Doesn't make sense if there's one page
		- Small button - requires precise selection
		- Symbol is somewhat ambiguous
		- Switching pages is weird - why not tile the pages to see all of them at once individually?
			- Partially a design feature to adapt to publishers, partially a hardware issue (not enough memory to render all things)
	- Fixed size thumb instead of one that changes size to the document
- Macintosh (1984)
	- OK, let's get rid of the page button since it's weird for some people
		- Click in a gray region, hold down to keep moving in a direction
	- What if you hold the up button and it repeats? Yeah, now it actually works in this version.
	- Press in the thumb and drag to get to a particular point in the document
		- Xerox Star actually stole this feature that you can move your mouse out to scroll in the later version!
		- Abort by dragging (far) out of the scroll bar before release
		- Remove the scrollbar if it's not needed, if you can see the full document
		- The scrollbar disappears if the window is not focused - i.e., you see the window in the background but it disappears
- Alternate Reality Kit (Xerox, 1985)
	- Animated environment for creating interactive simulations
		- A hand, a switch, a slider
	- Hand at edge causes scrolling to start from that side
	- Teleporters to move faster
		- Allow to quickly move an input device to go somewhere faster, including your cursor
- OpenLook
	- Elevator with arrow keys
		- But if you click the arrow on the scroll bar, it moves as well, so you need to correct your mouse and click it again
	- Clicking on the cable moves by pages
	- Cable anchors show the beginning and end of the document
	- Drag from center of elevator to move the elevator
	- Google Wave (2010) tried to fix it in their UI (not sure how this is relevant)
	- Eclipse: making a notch to show where the selection is
		- Show where you were before, e.g., source of where you started to copy code from
- NeXT
	- Scroll bars moved back to the left side of windows
	- Proportionally sized thumb to the document
	- Arrows are together at the bottom (both up and down arrows)
		- Auto repeat if you hold the button down
		- Alt-key then moves by full windows at a time instead of a small bit at the time
	- Drag thumb
		- Alt-key while dragging moves more slowly
	- Idea that it's not one window proportional to the text, but the entire content in the context of the full thing
	- Thought that it might not be beneficial to have the bar on the right, depending on the content
		- No user studies have been done to investigate left or right scrollbars
- OK what about a dedicated scroll wheel?
	- IntelliMouse by Microsoft with a scroll wheel - you can configure how many lines to scroll at once with the wheel, and even tilt it
		- A third button if you click the scroll wheel
		- Some can move smoothly without indents/notches
		- You can use it to zoom in software, e.g., CAD
		- Scroll wheel could also be combined with clicks, e.g., selecting multiple cells in a column without moving the mouse, just hold and then scroll simultaneously
	- How to scroll horizontally?
		- Hold shift
		- Use the middle-click mover
		- Tilt the scroll wheel
		- Have a dedicated horizontal scroll wheel
- Rate-controlled scrolling
	- Can enable press and hold of mouse wheel
		- Faster if moved further from press point
	- E.g., pressing the middle button (trackpoint) on a thinkpad and pull with pointing stick to move/select faster
	- Means you don't have to spin the mouse wheel forever to scroll throughout the page
		- Or y'know, use the scroll bar...
- Palm Pilot
	- Scroll bar, with dedicated scroll buttons (physical), and it showed you how big the doc was with proportional thumb
- RIM Blackberry
	- Use a physical scroll wheel used by your actual thumb - Bi-manual interaction
	- Issue: accidental selection because you were possibly using your dominant hand for both keyboard and scroll wheel
		- E.g., scroll first, then press OK button, then repeat
			- You can't parallelize it unless you got a good thumb and index finger, or risk bad input
- Macintosh newer scrollbars
	- 1997: We got a fixed-size thumb, and arrows at top and bottom
	- 2001: Thumb bar now proportional, with both arrow buttons at bottom
	- 2007: What if we made a really thin scrollbar?
	- 2011: What if we got rid of the buttons and made it really light?
		- If you lose focus of the doc or stop scrolling, the scrollbar disappears
		- For some things, it might be good because it removes clutter
		- For some things, it's bad because you need to know the progress through the document, if you don't know what it is (e.g., presenting someone else's work + timing)
- iPhone (2007): flick to scroll
	- Technically existed before, as dynatable
	- Highly tuned momentum function, stops when you touch the screen as a scroll interrupt
	- Patent 7,469,231
	- However, it also bounces at the end of the document, again also moment/collision
		- Patented, obviously, and doesn't exist on some other systems
		- Optimized as well to have fluid motion
- How to make scrolling faster? Anchors to jump in a scroll list
	- E.g., iOS with sidebar jump (e.g., contacts list, ABCs)
	- Visual (unusable scrollbar) in some applications, e.g., web browser
- How about touchpads?
	- Two finger scroll, can be used to flick
- How about a clickpad?
	- Old iPod with the dial
	- old Adobe Photoshop / MacPaint / Microsoft Suite has a grab hand
	- Tap at edge, flick at edge on some simple readers
	- Infinite scroll on platforms - a usability/performance issue, especially for accessibility readers
		- If you scroll too far, the parts above might disappear making it hard to ctrl F
		- Hard for goal-oriented tasks (which is usually the purpose, addiction lol)
	- Scroll bars that show extra info, e.g., errors, breakpoints, etc. (usually in IDEs)
		- Find locations
	- VSCode with the big sidebar preview of the document
	- Sliders: a widget for range control, both a control and a display
		- Some have up/down arrows as well
		- Some have multiple arrows (e.g., start/end)
