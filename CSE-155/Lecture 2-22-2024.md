Descriptive model: a technique, or a research in a specific area
Now moving to Predictive models: allow UX designers to predict the performance of a computer system
- Predict performance before building, but also do a study on the final build because sometimes predictive models don't reflect the real thing
- But saves time/money on ideas that don't work
- Examples of mediated performance, measure human performance

# Speed-Accuracy Trade-Off
- In perceptual-motor tasks, there is a tradeoff between how fast a task can be performed and how many mistakes are made in performing the task
	- Users can either perform *very fast with many errors* or *very slow with few errors*
		- Or a good compromise, depending on how severe an error is/how long it'd take to correct the error
		- Example: withdrawing from a bank doesn't need to be fast, but must be accurate (don't pick the wrong value)
		- Example 2: data entry of 100 records in a form can be fast by utilizing keyboard input (tab/enter), and errors can be quickly corrected using backspace/arrow keys
	- Our goal is to design interfaces and interaction techniques that are both fast and accurate
		- Or maintain a reasonable balance between the two
- Skill acquisition
	- When learning a skill, we begin as *novices*
	- Initial performance is poor, but with practice, we acquire skill
	- With continued practice, we become proficient, perhaps *experts*
- The novice to expert transition is well suited to predictive mdoeling
	- Dependent variable: proficiency (e.g., the time or speed in doing a task)
	- Independent variable: amount of practice (e.g., hours, days, months, blocks, sessions - some unit of time)
	- Get the best performance possible from the user

### Power Law of Learning
$y = b * x^a$ and $T_n = T_1 * n^a$
$T_n$ the time to do the task on the $n^{th}$ trial
$T_1$ the time to do the task on the 1st trial (a constant)
$n$ the trial indicator (e.g., hours, days, blocks, sessions)
$a$ a constant setting the shape of the curve (depends on task)

Note: $a$ is **negative** since task completion time decreases with practice

- Relationship between proficiency and practice is non-linear
	- Initial small practice is substantial improvement
	- But later, a lot of practice only gives you minimal improvement

$S_n = S_1 * n^a$
- Dependent variable can be speed, the reciprocal of time
- Model predicts *tasks per unit time*, like Words per Minute (WPM)

$S_n$ the time to do the task on the $n^{th}$ trial
$TS1$ the time to do the task on the 1st trial (a constant)
$n$ the trial indicator (e.g., hours, days, blocks, sessions)
$a$ a constant setting the shape of the curve (depends on task)

Note: $a$ is **positive** and **less than 1** because speed still increases, but slowly

do you remember stats? we have $r$ and $r^2$ values for fit

All figures need a crossover time (very very important), where if you're comparing one system over another, you need to include where one system is better than another (even if it's not in your favor)

### Power Law of Learning: Log-log Model
If $x$ and $y$ data are transformed to log scale, the relationship is linear
- Useful if you want a slope that is a constant
- Only because the original formula is exponential
- Use stats to figure out how to make your model better
- Also all models should be exponential - if somehow log-log is not linear, you probably screwed up

## Human Diversity
- Human performance is highly complex:
	- Humans differ a lot, meaning their performance will differ between individuals
- But with statistics and a lot of people, we can approximate performance using a normal distribution
- Reaction time is the easiest indicator of human performance
	- The delay between the occurrence of a signal fixed stimulus and the initiation of a response assigned to it
		- E.g., pressing a button in response to the onset of a stimulus light
		- Useful for measuring input methods against one another

### Fitts' Law
- One of the most widely used models in HCI
- Model for rapid aimed movements
	- Such as, moving a cursor toward a target and selecting a target
- Three applications:
	- Use a Fitts' law prediction equation to analyze and compare design alternatives (predictive)
	- Use Fitts' *index of performance* (now *throughput*) as a dependent variable in a comparative evaluation
	- Determine if a device or technique conforms to Fitts' law
		- In other words: Predict performance, run tests, see if it matches
		- If your system does not comply to Fitts' law, your system will not work.
- E.g., Task Paradigms:
	- Use a task with two inputs and two lights: given a light, click the correct side, and see how fast a person reacts depending on how far the inputs are, how big the inputs are, and how bright the lights are
	- Metrics:
		- Fitts' index of difficulty is a measure of the difficulty of a target selection task
			- I.e., can they do the task fast and well?
		- Normally the prediction equation is built for using the effective index of difficulty ($ID_e$) that includes an "adjustment for accuracy"
			- $ID=\log_2\left(\frac{A}{W} + 1\right)$
			- Based off Shannon-Hartley formula (if you've taken CSE-160, you know this by heart)
		- The movement time (MT) is measured in seconds for each trial, then averaged over the sequence of trials
		- Fits hypothesized that the relationship between movement time (MT) and (ID) is linear
			- $MT=a+b\log_2\left(\frac{A}{W}+1\right)$
			- $a$ (seconds) and $b$ (seconds per bit) depend on each study
	- Throughput
		- Bits per second: $Throughput = \frac{ID}{MT}$
		- Alternative definition: $Throughput = \frac{1}{bits}$
		- Yes, bits: $b$ is the slope of the regression line, equivalent to $\frac{ID}{MT}$ when $a=0$
- Application of Fitts' law: Pointing devices
	- Task: compare four pointing devices
	- 12 participants performed a series of serial target selection tasks using the four devices
	- For the example, we will only look at the data and models for two of the devices
	- Requires a serial task for Fittz' law (something that can be parallelized may cause issues with comparing tasks)
	- Not randomized, can be the same order always
	- Movement time can be high but difficulty can be lowered, but not always (speed and accuracy)
	- Not predicting performance, measuring it in this case
- Fittz' Law for predictions can be used when the linear regression (for loglog) is calculated
- Limitations:
	- Only models movement
	- Repeat exercises to remove user reaction (thinking)
	- Predicts "expert" behavior (not a learning study - needs to be familiar with the system)
	- Weak link between Shannon model and Shannon's information theory on bits of information
		- Not good for people who are information theory people
- Choice Reaction Time
	- Given $n$ stimuli, associated one-to-one with $n$ responses, the time to react to the onset of a stimulus is the *choice reaction time*
## HickHyman Law: Application
- Time to select items in a hierarchical menu
- Activation time for mode switching with non-dominant hand in a tablet interface
- Limitations:
	- Difficult to apply because additional behaviors are often present, such as visual search
- Sensory stimuli and Reaction Time
	- Delay time varies by type of sensor stimuli
	- Approximate values
		- Auditory: 150 ms
		- Visual: 200ms
		- Smell: 300ms
		- Pain: 700ms
- Skilled Behavior
	- For many tasks, human performance improves considerably and continuous with practice
	- However, very little improvement with practice in simple reaction time tasks
	- In these tasks, there is interest in studying the progression of learning and the performance achieved according to the amount of practice
	- Categories of skilled behavior
		- Sensory-motor skill (e.g., darts, gaming)
			- All impulsive, less thinking
		- Mental skill (e.g., chess, program)
			- Thinking more than writing: easy to write a 2 liner if you know wtf you're doing
		- Both (e.g., text entry)
			- You need to think before you write as well, such as typing an essay
