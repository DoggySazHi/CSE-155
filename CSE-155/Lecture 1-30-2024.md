## Continuing on Auditory Signals
- For more professional users, you do not need long, expressive auditory feedback
	- i.e., shorter startup times for more people used to your application who understand what each cue means
- Auditory signals can complement other factors, especially if providing assistance for low vision or blind people
	- LVB
	- Almost used exclusively for such people, but can be added with e.g., haptic feedback to provide faster response or input recognition (e.g., clicking a button is faster than saying your command, and may be preferred in cases where people cannot speak everything)
		- Speaking speed can be decreased for first-time users, or increased for people used to a system even with pure auditory systems
		- Haptic feedback and audio can be used to provide two types of feedback - redundancy which can help in certain scenarios such as loud areas or wearing gloves
		- Issue: how to avoid "scanning" on interfaces vs direct interaction, especially if the person cannot see?
			- Either memorize or allow the user to input via alternative means
			- e.g., touchscreens: not very natural input, but also while gestures provide more degrees of feedback, it will be hard to memorize/learn controls
				- Even more bad for people who are used to different shortcuts, such as before an accident
				- A lot of actions for a simple action, if you only use touchscreens or speech
				- External peripheral is also bulky, and needs more than just the device they're using
		- People who are LVB and use speech do not like doing it in public because they perceive it as annoying to others
			- Avoid using outside, meaning less usability
		- Tilt/accelerometer feedback is also an option, but it may lead to physical fatigue
		- Alternative input methods that don't involve scanning? Just want to involve text
			- Specialized keyboards that are physical, also expensive for accessibility
			- Morse code: an option, but input is hard to learn but easy to do, also hard to correct the message
				- Cost of error is high: for one error, you delete multiple actions inputted previously
					- e.g., three taps, few more taps to delete or one super long tap
				- vs a normal keyboard: mistype a key, press backspace: 1 - 1
			- **Chord** for input?
				- Press multiple keys for text input + predictive feedback
				- Faster input
					- Kinda like a stenograph
				- Specialized keyboard, can be replicated on a touch screen, and allows for faster entry since it uses both hands (or even more fingers)
					- But *very* hard to learn
					- Could also use auditory feedback for even faster input, but it's loud
						- Technically you could use headphones... but also inconvenient
				- Braille is also a chorded technique (different bumps mean different letters)
					- But, only 3% of people who are blind know braille!
						- Most people aren't born blind, and only those people go to schools to learn it
		- Lots of research into LVB products, many good ideas, but hard to make into a product
			- Making it paid, profitable, and compatible
- General conclusion: provide audio feedback with visual feedback, if it makes sense
	- Might not need it depending on your users, but also make it an option to enable for certain cases
	- Multimodal as a choice or an option

# Touch Feedback
- Touch (Tactition)
- Part of somatosensory system (i.e., physical feeling)
	- Receptors in skin, muscles, joints, and bones
		- Sense of touch, pain, temperature, shape, texture, resistance, etc.
		- One of our primary human ways to feel and know something
	- Many ways to get tactile feedback, from many different places
		- Keyboards/switches, moving a physical object (mouse), rotation (scroll wheel), even vibration
		- All of them are basically a force/reaction that we feel as input and the device detects as feedback/input
	- Not all input needs to be directly reactive: the nubs on the F and J button help a typist understand where to place their fingers
		- But it can be - phone notifications and haptic feedback are reactive
- Touch input methods
	- Duh, touchscreen
		- Also supports multi-tap and gestures
			- But relatively limited types of reaction: it's either touching or not
			- May also support force, either physically or by detecting area of touch
		- Screen readers for feedback
	- Haptic feedback
		- Vibration, usually for notifications
		- Shape (obstacles, constraints, a physical block)
		- Texture (knowing what something feels like or might do)
		- Resistance (can be like a constraint, knowing how far something goes or if they shouldn't be doing something)
			- All can be used to simulate real-life physical items, e.g., car simulators where a gear shift needs to have specific positions/constraints, and friction/resistance for actually shifting
		- How to haptic feedback?
			- Improved performance in precise selection
				- (note: imprecise selection exists if there exists a snapping action)
				- Can be provided on reaching target, on selection, or both
					- Back-feedback from computer, e.g., possible snapping position or mouse over a specific point
					- Can be used like targeting a specific location
						- More vibration when a position is closer to a specific position
				- Facilitates learning (passive haptic learning)
					- Easy to learn how to use, since you get assistance/instant feedback
					- Physical learning (e.g., learning to play a piano by vibrating the right fingers to tell the user which ones to play - learn into muscle memory but learn from feeling)
				- Can be removed when transitioned from novice to expert
	- Vibration feedback
		- Duration of the vibration control signal should be between 50ms and 200ms
			- (too short and I don't feel it, too long and it's annoying)
				- Somewhat subjective, more for the lower bound
		- Perceived pleasantness depends on the characteristics of the tactile feedback parameters that define the wave shape of the stimuli
			- Uhhh we're talking about computer feedback, right?
			- Different frequencies and duration may be perceived differently, as well as different patterns
			- Most pleasant tactile feedback on finger
				- 46mA drive current for the piezo actuator (solid-state)
				- 16ms drive time for the vibration motor (constant voltage)
			- Vibratory feedback is too much sensory feedback for some people
				- Hard to provide concentrated vibration that doesn't affect surroundings
					- Also hard to feel across the body instead of just specific locations
		- How to type on a ~~macbook~~ flat keyboard like a phone touchscreen?
			- Especially for people not used to a phone keyboard
				- If they get used to it, it's possible that existing techniques are *useless* or even *decrease* performance
			- Tactile feedback helps speed and accuracy *only if* it's relevant to existing experience
				- E.g., tactile feedback to know if a button was pressed
				- but not useful if you've been born with a phone or used one for a while and got used to it!
			- How about attaching a tactile interface on top?
				- Good idea, but 1. people might be used to flawed interfaces, or 2. expensive to implement!
					- Tactus: phone touchable interface
					- MIT inFORM: physical interface, but artifical constraints - need to push farther more or less than needed
						- Not equal force applied or received, let alone distance
		- How about force feedback?
			- Apply 3D force vectors at different points for kinesthetic feedback
				- kinematics and possibly inverse kinematics
			- Usually grounded on one part of the body (e.g., forearm) or a surface to provide feedback on another (e.g., fingers) by exerting localized force that restrict the natural degrees of freedom of the body
			- Separate motors are required for each component of the exerted force
				- How to make it light to not feel it, or not expensive to implement? While also allowing it to still provide significant feeling for constraint or tactileness?
				- Is virtual feeling supposed to be realistic? Like, all reactions are 1:1 or can interactions be different than real life?
					- Philosophical question
		- How about... air vortexes???
			- Use air vortex rings to provide feedback - travels a distance and can be detected by a computer
			- But requires water.... much more bulky and not portable
				- But, it doesn't need to be touch-to-touch with something physical
				- Latency and delay relatively high since the ring needs to be shot 
		- How about... sound???
			- Ultrasonic, actually - detect the position of a hand over a region of transducers
				- And you can potentially feel it, as touch feedback and it's relatively instantaneous
					- An artificial physical interface that you don't see
				- No physical touch and doesn't require external resources
				- Also "loud"/EMF, but humans don't care
				- Feedback moves around with hand and is limited to an area, but to the human feels large
				- Heavy processing required to focus the ultrasonic transducers upon a region
			- Turns out ultrasound can kill you...
				- think about ultrasonic cleaners, and weapons
					- punching tiny holes through your body if it's loud enough
				- Can irritate and bruise your skin
			- Also may need other sensors to detect position
				- e.g., in VR, it's hard to use multiple fingers - faster with only two fingers to detect due to accuracy and precision when detecting fingers in space
			- Faster and less errors if the feedback is on press and not just touch
			- Closer to the world because to do everything
	- **NOTE (idkw here to put this)** some feedback is also usable for rehab
		- How about... no feedback?
			- Well, more of non-vibration haptic feedback - virtual reality uses them a lot
				- E.g., electric shock, air pockets, heat
				- Cannot restrain much movement but it is human feedback
				- Different patterns, duration, intensity, determined based on the system (different range for different systems)
