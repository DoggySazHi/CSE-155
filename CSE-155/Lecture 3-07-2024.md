# Modes
- Menus, undo/redo, and more this time...
- A mode is a functioning arrangement or condition
	- Software or visual, different interfaces for the same interaction, or even specialized interactions for specific contexts
- Mods are everywhere, in most cases unavoidable (e.g., limited space/hardware/money)
	- You have to make sure that the limited actions are capable of doing a lot of tasks
- E.g., Office phone light
	- On: message waiting
	- off: no messages

Example: what if you used emacs or MSWord and had to remember 6 different permutations of Ctrl, Shift, Alt, and F9 for different modes?

Example: International keyboards
- How to input accents or symbol?
	- Modifier keys, combination (e.g., normally illegal combinations to create a new/valid chraracter)
	- On the keyboard, it's possible that some keys are labelled with three symbols (instead of 2, like the top-row where they can be accessed by shift)
		- Typewriters do this, both with shift and a special meta/control key
		- On Windows, usually you can use the alt key (usually the right alt, sometimes depicted as Alt Gr)
- What if the keyboard is virtual, like on a phone?
	- For modern systems, press/hold the key allows you to access different characters
		- What about say, Chinese?
			- IME system
	- How about moving the cursor?
		- Usually holding spacebar allows you to switch to a trackpad-like mode
		- Some tried a virtual pointing stick, but nobody uses them IRL anymore, so it's weird for some users (people like 1:1, isometric movement)
	- How about putting a force sensor/cell in a phone?
		- Nobody used 3D Touch...
- OK, how about more compact ways of menu navigation?
	- We got Nokia phones, they're pretty useful as bricks but they also have a dedicated navigation button
	- The screen shows the mode though, to keep note of the feedback
		- The hardware gets the input, you use the software/virtual display to show the new controls
		- Also noticed on monitor controls, hence why we have a menu, ok, up/down arrows (four buttons for a full hierarchal menu)
		- Same thing on TVs but it's not universal - some use an IR pointing device (like a wii lol)
- We have Microsoft PowerPoint...
	- Changing view modes, like editing, presentation, slides, and highlighting the mode the current user is in
		- Providing visual feedback, even if it's obvious that the mode changed - allows you to know what mode you're in when you start
- We have watches...
	- Keep pressing a button and you switch between different modes
	- Depends on how many options you need to pick from: a  long list should be cyclable (or just not even use a cyclable), a short list not 
## Mode Visibility
- Always, *always* tell the user what mode they're in, since it makes everything obvious
- You don't want to accidentally induce stress in the user (or make them prone to errors)
	- E.g., difference between insert and overwrite mode

DOF
- Mouse inputs are usually 2 DOF (two translation) and screens are 3 DOF (two translation, one rotation)
	- Technically optical mice are also three DOF but drivers usually don't exist
	- Soft solutions also work, such as grab tools for more DoF
	- Or have mice dedicated for higher DoF since CAD software lol
- More DoF not necessarily better
	- Context is necessary
	- E.g., an etch-and-sketch doesn't need the full drawing capabilities but it's still fun to use

Scrolling
- Sketchpad
	- Pan and zoom with knobs
		- The size and position of the part of the total picture
- Bravo (1975)
	- Move to left margin: cursor changes shape
	- Why left for scrolling up and right to scrolling down instead of y'know, up/down arrows?
		- Pagination iirc
- Smalltalk (1917)
	- Scroll bar pops up to the left of the document
	- Focus window has a scroll bar
	- Three regions:
		- Right region: text moves up
		- Left region: text moves down
		- Center: drag thumb smoothly
	- Thumb shows percent visible
- WordStar, Interlisp
	- Interlisp stole the popup from Smalltalk
	- Interlisp also stole the pagination left/right from Interlisp
- Star OS
	- Scrollbar on the right
	- Scroll arrow on the bar
	- +/- buttons to scroll by page
	- You can click in the bar to jump to a specific position of the document
	- Viewpoint: allow you to scroll even if your mouse moves off horizontally
		- You can also move by right click by page/window, but it's not often used
