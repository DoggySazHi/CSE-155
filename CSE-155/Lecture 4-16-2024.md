- Purposive sampling (judgement sampling)
	- Selecting a sample of users that are most likely to address the research question efficiently
- Theoretical sampling (advocated with grounded theory)
	- Recruiting people who are most likely to test, expand, and help build the theory that is emerging through data gathering and analysis
		- Keep extracting samples from the population to narrow down a question
	- Only possible when data collection and analysis are interleaved
- Convenience sampling
	- Working with the most accessible participants (the easiest approach)
	- Biased, but at least it's from your team picking from the population
- Snowball sampling
	- Each participant introduces further participants to the study
	- Not the researchers bringing people, but the participants bringing in more participants (very biased)
		- Sample picks more samples

- How many people to bring?
	- Small: not enough statistical significant
	- Big: forgot

- Experiment Design: Within-subjects vs. Between-subjects
	- Within: Fewer participants, less variation, no balancing (only one group)
		- But, there are effects between ordering (what if doing one experiment before another affects the results of the later ones?)
	- Between:
		- No order effects
		- But, more variation, more participants, and you need different groups

- Counter-balancing: How to optimize the number of people and the number of experience they have to do
	- Removes the ordering effect for the number of test cases
	- You can permutate using factorial, or randomize
		- E.g., target sizes to permutate, movement directions, and/or movement distances
		- If all are tested, you probably want to randomize it since permutating them means multiplying them *then* applying the factorial, e.g., really big permutation list
- Nominal (only mode, like demographics/gender)
- Ordinal (Comparison, mMedian)
- Interval, Ratio (Mean)
