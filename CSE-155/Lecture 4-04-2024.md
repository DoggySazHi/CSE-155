## Making testable questions
- Change the design practices to fit the nature of research
- Do you change the process of research to change our design, or vice-versa?
- What distinguishes design from research and vice-versa?
	- Are they correlated? Is there a line between them?

## UX Design
- Why are they using the software?
	- Big goals, like motivation
- What do they need to do?
	- Actions, functionality
- How are they going to do it?
	- Accessibility, aesthetics, feedback
- NOT trying to find the relationships between interactions, just these simple questions

What's the difference between a user study and a usability evaluation?

How does research and development happen?
- Research: at the start, the invention phase
	- Earliest step, figuring out novel techniques and how certain features could be accomplished/made
- Materials/processes: OK, we know something is probably possible, how could we make it?
- Engineering/Design: Let's try making a prototype and refining it, using our known info from before
- Product: We finally got something, let's sell it

Never have a conclusion before the data - a hypothesis is fine, but don't be invested in it
- You may bias your judgement
- Your perception or preconception may alter your interpretation of the data to warp the results
- Focus on what the data means, not what you want it to mean

Relevance vs Precision:
- How do we get data that's realistic (e.g., an actual work environment) and precise (can be controlled)?
	- The range is the actual application environment to a lab environment: one is super natural, and the other is super controlled
	- We can't really get both without the participants realizing they're in a study

How do we analyze the data?
- Cause-and-effect can't be done, because you can find correlation but **not** causation
- Observational studies do not have the strongest control and is hard to define correlation
- Experimental studies can suggest correlation with strong hypotheses, but is not relevant

Fast prototyping:
- Why write code for the full application when you can do design in steps?
	- Designing using wireframes (non-functional) is a faster way to iterate
	- Obviously not the closest to the real thing (i.e., a software prototype) but it's usually good enough
		- Adding click/action prototypes makes it even closer
			- Hard to distinguish between this and a mockup
	- Iterating time is reduced but you have to have people knowledgeable in setting up mockup editors

Types of prototyping:
- Sketch prototype: Literally draw on a piece of paper and show visually what it'd work
	- Note: very nice to get feedback since they know you haven't started working - willing to suggest dramatic changes since they know you can iterate faster
- Click prototype: Simple GUI editor like Figma or even PowerPoint to make links between clickable elements and the other panels
- Wireframing: Put the content, to test user attention span
